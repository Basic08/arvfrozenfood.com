    <h2>1.) “Can I buy from the frozen food section in the grocery store and still be eating healthy?”  </h2>
     <p>Many frozen foods allow us to eat fruits and vegetables that are not in season. Also, many are budget-friendly.
	 The quality of frozen foods has improved in the last several years.</p>           
	<h2>2.) “If I lose power, how long will my frozen food last?”  </h2>
     <p>If you avoid opening the freezer door during a power outage, a full freezer should stay frozen for two days. </p>           	
	 <h2>3.) “What are some ways I can make ‘DIY’ frozen meals?” </h2>
     <p>Meats: Preparing any type of meat not only takes time, it creates dirty dishes. The next time you are cooking chicken breast or frying up ground hamburger or turkey for chili, spaghetti, or tacos, prepare double and freeze half for the next time. Not only will you have saved time cooking, you won’t have to clean the frying pan a second time!

<br><br>Leftovers: If you have already eaten your dish twice and can’t bear to eat it a third time, freeze what’s left. Depending on the leftover, consider portioning it into a single serving container to grab as a homemade frozen meal for lunch. Keep a log on your refrigerator to remind you. </p>
	 <h2>2.) “Are there good and bad foods for freezing? “”  </h2>
     <p>Foods that freeze well: baked goods, burgers burritos, calzones, casseroles, cooked beans, cooked grains, egg rolls, enchiladas, French toast, quiche, lasagna, manicotti, mashed potatoes, meatballs and meatloaf, pancakes, pot pies, poultry, roasted meats, sauces, sloppy Joes, soup, stuffed shells, taco fillings, tofu, TVP, and waffles.

<br><br>Foods that do NOT freeze well: egg- and cream-based sauces, instant rice, salad, stuffed poultry, hard-cooked eggs and fried foods. </p>
